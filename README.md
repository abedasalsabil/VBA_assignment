Hello! My name is Abeda Salsabil, and this is the description of my VBA Assignment.

The ticker symbol, total volume, yearly change, and percent change are calculated and
allocated in the I, J, K, and L columns, respectively, using the VBA module named TickerCounter.

I made sure to use VBA to allocate headings to each column, as well.

I made a second VBA script called Greatest_percent_change in order to calculate the "greatest % increase", "greatest % decrease", and "greatest total volume" based off of the data created from the TickerCounter script. 
The new table for them will be generated in columns N, O, and P. 

However, I later incorporated my Greatest_percent_change script into the end of TickerCounter script in order to make it all run at once.  

Therefore, if you run the script of TickerCounter, it should be able to run all requirements stated on the assignment, at once. 

This assignment was very fun to make!

I would like to thank all the TA's and LA's who have helped and answered my thousand questions with VBA scripting. I am greatful for everybody's help throughout this process. 

Thank you and happy VBA scripting!
